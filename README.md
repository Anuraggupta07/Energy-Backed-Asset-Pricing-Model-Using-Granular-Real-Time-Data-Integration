#### **Title**:
# Energy-Backed Asset Pricing Model Using Granular Real-Time Data Integration

---

#### **Project Overview**:
This repository contains the implementation of an asset pricing model that uses real-time energy production data (oil, gas, renewables) and financial market information to predict asset values. By incorporating machine learning algorithms and integrating sustainability metrics (ESG), this model aims to help investors and energy companies manage risk, hedge against volatility, and invest in sustainable energy-backed assets.

---

#### **Features**:
- **Granular Real-Time Data Integration**: Fetch real-time data from energy sources and financial markets.
- **Machine Learning Predictive Model**: Time-series forecasting with LSTM and reinforcement learning models.
- **ESG Integration**: Factor in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) metrics to offer a sustainable investment perspective.
- **Risk and Investment Insights**: Generate insights for risk management, asset pricing, and investment decisions.

---

#### **Technology Stack**:
- **Languages**: Python
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Keras
- **Data Sources**: APIs for energy (EIA, Open Power System Data) and financial data (Alpha Vantage, Quandl)
- **Visualization Tools**: Matplotlib, Plotly
- **Deployment**: Flask or Streamlit for API/dashboard integration

#### **Setup Instructions**:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Energy-Backed-Asset-Pricing-Model.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Download and prepare the datasets by running the data loader:
   ```bash
   python src/data_loader.py
   ```
4. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python src/model.py
   ```

---

#### **Usage**:
Once set up, the model can be run locally or deployed to a web dashboard using Flask or Streamlit for real-time predictions. The user can input energy and financial data, and the model will return the predicted asset price along with sustainability insights.
